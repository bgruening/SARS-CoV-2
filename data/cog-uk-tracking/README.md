The JSON file in this folder provides the Galaxy metadata for all currently
processed batches of PE-Illumina sequenced COG-UK data. It lists which ENA
records are part of which analysis batch in Galaxy, and provides direct links
to the corresponding Galaxy histories, i.e., you can track the complete
analysis of each processed COG-UK sample starting from this file.
